# Vulnerability-Assessment-and-Penetration-Testing-on-Metasploitable-2

The Metasploitable virtual machine is a purposefully vulnerable version of Ubuntu Linux that may be used to test security tools and demonstrate common flaws. This virtual machine’s version 2 is now available for download, and it contains even more vulnerabilities than the initial image. VMWare, VirtualBox, and other popular virtualization platforms are all compatible with this virtual machine. The network interfaces of Metasploitable are bound to the NAT and Host-only network adapters by default, and the image should never be exposed to a hostile network. This Virtual Machine (Metasploitable2) can be used to conduct security training, test security tools, and practice common penetration testing techniques.

## Pre-requirements

First, we need to download VMWare Workstation Pro or VirtualBox (your choice of selection). It enables users to create and run Virtual Machines (VMs) directly on a single Windows or Linux desktop or laptop, where we can run any Operating System through this software on another Operating System. In this walkthrough, I am using VMWare Workstation Pro to set up the Metasploitable-2 on my computer.

- **VMWare Workstation Pro**: [VMWare Workstation Pro Download](https://www.vmware.com/in/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html)
- **VirtualBox**: [VirtualBox Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download)

Now you can download the **Kali Linux OS** for attacking the machine.

## Downloading and Setting up Metasploitable-2

Now we need to download the Metasploitable-2 image to our system. The compressed file is about 800 MB and can take a while to download over a slow connection. After you have downloaded the Metasploitable-2 file, you will need to unzip the file to see its contents.

- **Download Metasploitable-2**:
  - [Rapid7 Metasploitable Download](https://information.rapid7.com/metasploitable-download.html)
  - [SourceForge Metasploitable Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/)

After downloading the Metasploitable2 Image, open VMWare Workstation Pro and follow these steps to set up Metasploitable2:

1. Click on the "Open a Virtual Machine" button.
2. Select the Metasploitable2 image and click the "Open" button.
